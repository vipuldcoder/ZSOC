# ZSOC
Hello Everyone,
I want to share some ideas for making zero to mastery towards doing something more meaningful to the community.  Here's the list goes:
1) Zero Summer of Code (ZSOC)  is a global program focused on bringing more developers into open source software development. Anyone work with an open source organization on a 3 month programming project under the guidance of Mentor. Which helps them learn skills from development prospective and get ready for industry standard jobs.
2) Zero Winter of Code is the same as ZSOC, But the duration of the program is during winters.
Note: As of I shared with my friend about this wonderful idea, He really got shocked and appreciate me for given the contribution of wonderful opportunity and he also told that if everything got approved by our Founder , I will help to find NGO's project and Sponsorship's to make this happen. 

Why I take this Indicative and How it help the Students/Developers/Non-Developers or For Everyone?
Ans: Because I saw that there are programs like GSOC, RGSSOC and many others. These are the programs made for only School/University Students are able to became participants, Only 1% to 5% chances. I saw that people/community who want to became a developer or engineer having skills, but can't get a job easily or need to struggle a lot and also invest money where they loose everything even for a single job. This is the major reason why I want to get started with this, So that we can help and build opportunities for those people who want a chance to get real industry experience and they get something for the value of time and after the completion of this program maybe they get a chance to work with the companies or internship opportunities and lots of Goodies as well.
